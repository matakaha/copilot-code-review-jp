## Nice work

You've successfully implemented a comprehensive GitHub Copilot code review workflow for the school's extracurricular activities website. This system will help maintain code quality as more teachers and students contribute to the project, ensuring the platform remains reliable for all of Mergington High School's clubs and activities.

### What you accomplished

In this exercise, you learned how to:

- **Request code reviews from Copilot in VS Code** for immediate feedback on uncommitted changes
- **Assign Copilot as a reviewer on GitHub pull requests** to catch issues before merging
- **Create custom instructions** to tailor review feedback to your team's standards and requirements
- **Implement automatic code reviews** using repository rulesets for consistent quality enforcement
- **Understand the benefits and limitations** of AI-powered code review in a collaborative environment

### Impact on your workflow

With GitHub Copilot Code Review implemented, you now have:

- **Consistent code quality** across all contributions from teachers and students
- **Automated feedback** that doesn't require your constant attention
- **Educational opportunities** for less experienced contributors to learn from AI suggestions
- **Scalable review process** that grows with your team
- **Proactive issue detection** before code reaches production

The activities website is now equipped to handle contributions from the entire school community while maintaining high standards and reliability for student registrations and club management.

### What's next?

- **Advanced customization**: Consider using [GitHub Models in Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to create even more specific and targeted review criteria
- **Team training**: Share your new review process with other teacher-collaborators and help them understand how to work with Copilot's feedback
- **Monitor and iterate**: Review the feedback quality over time and adjust your custom instructions based on what works best for your team
